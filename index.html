      <h3>Good design is<br> innovative</h3>
      <div id="description1">
      <p>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any<br> means, exhausted. Technological development<br> is always offering new opportunities for<br> innovative design. But innovative design always<br> develops in tandem with innovative technology,<br> and can never be an end in itself.</p>

      <h2>02</h2>
      <div id="description2">
      <h3>Good design makes a product useful</h3>
      <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy<br> certain criteria, not only functional, but also<br> psychological and aesthetic. Good design<br> emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst<br> disregarding anything that could possibly<br> detract from it.</p>

      <h2>03</h2>
      <div id="description3">
      <h3>Good design is aesthetic</h3>
      <p>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to<br> its usefulness because products we use every<br> day affect our person and our well-being. But<br> only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
